# LCC -  Libre Computer Club
LCC- Libre Computer Club is a nonprofit club founded in Bergen, Norway with a mission to explore technology perspectives and promote the freedom of people who use computers. We like Free Libre and OpenSorce software, freedom of information, distributed and decentralized technologies, blockchain, user's privacy and freedom of thought.
Our goal is to have fun and inspire people to experiment with and to build their utopia. This could be new tech hub for innovation and collaboration with other technologists and free thinkers.

### We stand for the values of Free Software Foundation (FSF)
The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is a nonprofit with a worldwide mission to promote computer user freedom. We defend the rights of all people who use software.

Source FSF: As our society grows more dependent on computers, the software we run is of critical importance to securing the future of a free society. Free software is about having control over the technology we use in our homes, schools and businesses, where computers work for our individual and communal benefit, not for proprietary software companies or governments who might seek to restrict and monitor us. The Free Software Foundation exclusively uses free software to perform its work.

The Free Software Foundation is working to secure freedom for computer users by promoting the development and use of free (as in freedom) software and documentation—particularly the GNU operating system—and by campaigning against threats to computer user freedom like Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) and software patents.

The free software movement is one of the most successful social movements to arise from computing culture, driven by a worldwide community of ethical programmers dedicated to the cause of freedom and sharing. But the ultimate success of the free software movement depends upon teaching our friends, neighbors and work colleagues about the danger of not having software freedom, about the danger of a society losing control over its computing.
